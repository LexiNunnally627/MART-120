        <p>When I started the class, I was only familiar with block coding from my time in FIRST Lego League and Tech Challenge. It was the one I was the most comfortable with. In this class, I got to learn more about it, and ways to utilize it in a fun way.</p>

        <span>App</span>
        <br>
        <p>I was super excited about this project. I loved making an app about my dogs' stories. It was fun finding cute photos of them and telling the story from their perspective.</p>

        <span>Scratch</span>
        <br>
        <p>I've heard of scratch before this project; however, I never played with it. Here I continued to use my dogs as inspiration. They have such a strange dynamic, which makes it really easy to create stories about them.</p>

        <p>I also struggled with making the image show up, so hopefully it works now. This is my favorite piece of artwork that I've made. It's a shot from my favorite tv show, with the characters removed. I made it all by hand in Photoshop.</p>
