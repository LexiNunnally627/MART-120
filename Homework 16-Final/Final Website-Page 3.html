        <span>Java</span>
        <p>Java was the section I was the most scared of. I knew nothing about it and it seemed intimidating. The homework for these sections definately took the longest. I definately struggled with this section; however, I am intersted in what else I could do with it. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some of my favorite pieces using Java.</p>
        <br>
        <div><a href="index(1).html" target="new">Moving Portait</a></div>
        <br>
        <p>The moving portraits simply made me laugh. I had a lot of fun messing with moving different shapes.</p>
        <br>
        <div><a href="game2.html" target="new">Ball Game</a></div>
        <br>
        <p>This game gave me the most heartache; however, I got through it and left with a product I'm proud of. I wish I changed somethings or figured out a better way to accomplish parts, but overall, I'm happy with it.</p>
