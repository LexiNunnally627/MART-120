	To me knowing a learning style is very beneficial to learning. I have always struggled with finding mine. I would think I learn one way, then switch to another way the next year. 
Now that school isn’t a constant battle in my life and I can focus on only a few classes at a time (instead of my high school's seven classes), I think I’ve finally found one that works for me. 
	

	When learning for school (like needing to go through a text book), I find myself really struggling to get through even a page of a book. I remember in my senior year, I took a dual 
credit class that required me to read an entire chapter of our dense textbook almost every night. It was very difficult for me to stay focused on reading something I wasn’t actively engaged in. 
These last few years have taught me that I’m really good at learning with audio and physical practice. Of course I still love achieving tasks with diagrams and some notes (like legos or building 
a shelf, I love building new shelves); however, for learning I’m noticing I’m retaining more info when it's spoken or when I can actively participate. For example, when I’m getting ready for work 
in the morning, I’ll stick on a podcast, or a video about my new hyperfixation for the month and just learn everything I can about the subject. Sometimes it’s a movie I’m really into and I just
 want to know about how the project was made or the secret meanings behind them, or maybe a true crime case for fun. When starting a new task at work, I love to see how it's done, but after a 
while I get bored and get excited to practice the new skill. Overall, knowing one's learning style is nice; however, I wish I caught onto mine much sooner than I did.
